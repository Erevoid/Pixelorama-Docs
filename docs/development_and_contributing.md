## Spread the word!
Talk to your friends, co-workers, people from your communities and anyone who might be interested about Pixelorama! You can promote it on your social media, make videos about it or, even better, draw! Create content using Pixelorama and tell the world that you used it for your creations! Making Pixelorama more popular is a win-win scenario for everyone, because more people knowing about it means that we will get more feedback, which will be used to make Pixelorama even better, and some people might be interested even in contributing code directly!

## Donations
Pixelorama is a free and open-source project. This means that all of our income so far comes solely from donations. If you wish to see this project grow and help us financially, you can become our [Patron](https://patreon.com/OramaInteractive). You can also buy Pixelorama on [itch.io](https://orama-interactive.itch.io/pixelorama), for an amount of your choice!

## Contributing Code
You are free to open pull-requests to [Pixelorama's GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama) to fix issues or implement new features. Keep in mind, however, that not all PRs will be merged. Some may need discussion, or others may be downright closed.

## Contributing Feedback
Did you find a bug? Do you have a super cool idea for the development of Pixelorama and want to share it? Then the best way to do it is by opening an [issue on Githib](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama/issues). That is the most effective way for your feedback to be seen and discussed with the team and other developers that are interested in helping.

## Contributing Translations

If you wish to contribute a translation, make sure to use [Pixelorama's Crowdin page](https://crowdin.com/project/pixelorama). Crowdin is a web-based translation platform, where people can contribute translations together and with ease. Please use Crowdin and do not directly open pull requests to Pixelorama's GitHub repository.
